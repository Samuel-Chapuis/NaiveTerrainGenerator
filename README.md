# Description
This project has to goal to create an algorithm to generate realistic terrain maps. For now the objective is to be able to simulate terrain Earth like. In a longer term it should be able to generate diffrent planet style map.

# Avancement
The project is at the real begining for now. It's a test phase of the generation with diffrent type of noise.
